<h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h2>
    <p>
    During the process of creating my website, Trello and Github has been helpful to me as they've allowed me to keep 
    track of my progression over time. Trello has helped me by allowing me to plan each section of my coursework out 
    into separate stages of progression, the progression test goes from inactive,in progress, double check and then stops 
    at completed.Each one of these trello tabs are even colour coordinated from red, yellow, orange to green. Github 
    on the other hand has been useful by allowing me to upload a version of the html file while im working on it so if 
    anything goes wrong I can download the files from the repository and work over the recent one that I uploaded, the 
    only thing that's odd about GitHub is that Github doesnâ€™t allow you to download one single file at a time, Instead you 
    have to download the entire repository in which the file is located but this is why comments are useful as they allow me 
    to notice the difference between each version.
