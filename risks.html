<h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h2>
    <p>
       During the creation of a project the developers, group or company could run into a few risks that ultimately lead to the 
       project being entirely scrapped and doomed to fail. Some of the risks that can lead a project to this form of failure are:
       <br>
            <br>Scheduling <br>
            <br>
                   Scheduling is an important factor that needs to be taken very seriously and planned out almost perfectly otherwise 
                   parts of the project could take more time than originally is required which can set back parts of the project or 
                   even the whole project and can result in the development cost slowly creeping higher and higher and if a company is 
                   backing the project up they may choose to cancel it if it doesnâ€™t meet a certain point or functionality within a 
                   specific timeframe.
                   <br>
                   <br>Costs <br>
                   <br>
                   Relating back to the scheduling, the cost plays a main role with a projects development as it has to be used to 
                   pay the developers, resources and hardware for the project and even excess stuff such as QA testers and sometimes 
                   engine licenses (The license for engines is more within the game development business). The cost of the project 
                   could be raised due to scope creep (which is an increase in the projects requirements over the lifecycle) , poor 
                   scheduling/ planning or even simply poor usage of the money by the company or group.
                   <br>
                   <br>Perfromance Risks <br>
                   <br>
                   Performance risk is the risk that when a project is complete, it may fail to perform the way a business requires 
                   or does not perform the way it was intended by the business. Performance risks can also lead into the schedule and 
                   cost risks if any of the technical problems increases the duration of the projects lifespan which at the same time will
                    increase the need of cost for the project.
                    <br>
                    <br>Risks associated with external hazards <br>
                    <br>
                   External hazards typically aren't as common but are highly unexpected, there are various types of external 
                   hazards that can ange from natural disasters, electromagntic interference, terrorism etc. Often a project 
                   should be backed up consistently incase any external hazard does take place or it'll result in the entire 
                   project being restarted from stage 1 and will need to cost extremely more as you may have to repair/ replace 
                   existing hardware.
