<h2> 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
   <p>IT is an essential part of any modern business, 
    no matter if it’s a big business that has to maintain company data and manage mainframe 
    systems or a small start up business that owns a singular computer, IT will always be needed. 
    The reasons why IT in businesses is important is due to how it’s used across the entire globe.</p>

    <p> For a high majority of companies, emails will primarily be
    the most used form of communication (other than face to face) to all employees,
    their suppliers and even to their customers. Over the past few years, technology has 
    grown to the point where staff members can communicate with each other over the internet,executive staff 
    can host online meetings using live video chat software (for example: Skype, ooVoo , etc) which is extremely beneficial 
    to most business as it’ll lower the travel expenses for meetings. IT can also be beneficial within the stockroom/warehouse 
    sections of a business as it can be used to manage the current inventory of the warehouse, 
    by doing this the staff can use the system to order more stock if the quantity gets lower than a set limit.</p>

    <p>
    Within this day and age, the old method of having large room filled with cabinets and the method of mailing documents is 
    getting closer and closer to being irrelevant. This is because companies can instead keep the documents saved digitally 
    and saved within servers and on various storage devices. Using this method ensures that employees can find the documents and 
    can view them when they need to, this enables almost immediate access to the documents.
    </p>

    <p>
     Businesses even use IT to improve their relationships with their customers by using a method/system called CRM( Customer 
    Relationship Management) to try and capture the interactions that the company will have with its customers, this method is 
    used to try and improve the overall customer experience. This often happens when a customer contacts the companies call centre 
    for help ,assistance or to file an issue with an order/item that the customer bought from them.
