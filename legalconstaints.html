    <h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h2>
    <p>
    When you are working on a project, there will be a plethora of legal guidelines that your business or group will 
     need to follow otherwise it can lead to a heavy impact of fines which can/ will likely damage the projects success 
    rate. These guidelines that need to be met are:
        <ul>
            <li>The right of users to grant consent for the use of their data
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    The GDPR (otherwise known as the General Data Protection Regulation) is the current support structure that
                     sets a guideline for the collection of personal information and the processing of the data.To ensure you don't
                      violate this and risk any impact to your project or business you need to simply set your website’s/app’s preferences 
                      to “no” or “blank” by default and also allow users to actively opt-in with the ability for users to just as easily opt-out 
                      if they aren’t interested anymore, any forms that you create for the project needs to have a minimum limit and it needs to 
                      only include data that is relevant for the task. For example on pay-as-you-go mobile services you simply get to choose whether 
                      you want to receive newsletters about deals via emails or messages so the company will only need to receive the email or mobile 
                      if the user is interested. If this section of the legal guideline is mishandled you could potentially be fined which can be upto 
                      10 million euros or upto 2% of the companies global turnovers.

                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Accessibility
                <ul>
                    <li>
                     Accessibility is the process of allowing any user to be able to access your content within your website, if you don't manage
                    to meet the requirements you will be breaching the Equality Act of 2010. To avoid breaching this Act you simply have to do a 
                    few things. First meet all the level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, this just implies that you've covered the
                    accessibility for people who have impairments to their vision,hearing,mobility, and for people who have trouble with thinking 
                    and understanding (this is to help people with dyslexia, autism, or any learning difficulty). By standard every website should 
                    have some features such as speak recognition, screen magnifiers, screen readers and more useful tools to aid people. You should 
                    also conduct some form of disability user research to gain insight on which things may help them.   
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Cyber security and protecting personal data
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    As a business it'll be your responsibility to ensure the security of all user information that is gathered within 
                    your website such as; name, address, debit/credit card details, etc, is kept secure at all costs. To possibly prevent this you’ll have to 
                    implement an ssl certificate inside your website which will encrypt the users personal data, updating your websites
                    software often will be a huge advantage. You should also test your own website to check for any security 
                    vulnerabilities that may be present. If you have a poor system setup and somehow information about your customers
                    is let out then your projects reputation and business reputation will be lowering and you may be faced with a fine
                    that could put any project at a risk.
