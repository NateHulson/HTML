    <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
    </h2>    <p>
        When testing any digital project, no matter what type of project it is, there will always be some form of testing that needs to be taken care off otherwise your more than likely have an open project that anyone can abuse to their heart's content. Although testing isn't easy its worth the precaution as it can prolong the projects life cycle and also ensure it ends up as being a user friendly project that people might intend on using which in turn will generate more revenue. If i was to test any project or digital solution, for example my website, I would 
        try the following:
        <br>
        <br>
        QA testing
        <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes testing things on your own is efficient enough to spot as many issues that can come along with front or back end development, this is why QA testing is this day and age is more than required when creating any form of website, device etc. This method basically allows you to  spot as many bugs and problems possible in the same amount of time due to having a larger testing base. The way it works is that you hand the testers access to the project and within a set time they will have to find as many bugs and note individual moments when these bugs occur which then they have to try and replicate the bug to potentially help you find what couldâ€™ve caused the problem or bug. Although this can be a bit costly due to you having to pay people for working, it comes with the benefit of ensuring that your project will have little faults and issues as it possibly can.

        Security Testing
        <br>
        <br>
        Security is one of the main protocols of a website that needs to be checked upon more frequently due to the increasing amount of hackers,website vandalism and data theft. Security will always be a tough threat to tackle as there are a plethora of ways that a person or group can hack into a website, a few methods that can be used to sneak into a website is by : Password cracking, Url Manipulation, cross site scripting,etc. Password cracking is a simple one as it means that someone will just try to guess passwords and usernames by using password cracking tools/software if the website has not encrypted any of the login details, this is mandatory for all websites. Url manipulation is when someone uses the HTTPS GET request to request data from the server to the client, this is something a tester needs to be fully aware off.Cross site scripting is were an Html is able to be manipulated and coded by changing the script of the code, to test this you have to make sure the variables wont be recognised by any other scripting methods.

        <br>
        Performance Testing
        <br>
        <br>
        Performance testing is the method of  pushing your website with high traffic and testing if it can manage to keep a suitable performance, this is otherwise known as a stress test. A performance test is used on almost every platform server or domain to see what the limit of the services are, for example facebook which has a high amount of traffic on a day-to-day basis would have needed to plan ahead by using software that sends high amounts of data to their servers which gives the developers the required information to see which areas need working on. This method of digital testing is often more cost efficient.
