    <h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose 
    </h2>
    <p>During the creation of my website I would often be checking back to look and review some of the required parts to see if anything was mishandled or if it was right to use. This lead me to constantly double check my punctuation and grammar when I was writing up rough drafts of my content that I would intend to place within the website in different tabs and I also had to keep all the content organized. When it comes to designs I ultimately just saw issues that kept occurring such as backgrounds being the wrong size which made them pixelate when stretching out so I decided to scrap the idea of adding backgrounds as it would have been an eyesore to read any content. I was constantly checking my code to ensure that every paragraph and each link I implemented ,like navigation bar links and reference links, ended up working the way they were intended which was the outcome and it makes for easy transitions between each page with one click. I also had to make sure that all my files I used were correctly formatted as I did accidentally put some symbols in the name of one of the files which stopped it working as a HTML file and made it simply non usable for the task at hand, so I simply ensured that each page I made was set as a .html format so it would work for use on browsers for testing purposes. When it came to content I was going to add I was intentionally going to use, I wouldâ€™ve used a PNG format than a JPG  due to how a PNG format has less compression and image quality loss than a jpg but due to time restraints I wasn't able to find any images off so I scrapped the idea entirely.
