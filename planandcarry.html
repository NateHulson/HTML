<h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h2>    
    <p>
    When I’m making my website, I’ll be using various apps and sites to manage and aid with the websites creation. 
    One of the tools that I’ll use will be Trello simply because Trello is a perfect project management tool with easy 
    drag and drop options which I will use efficiently, and with Trello I can create task labels that will act as each 
    stage of the process.I will firstly start with a “to-do” process which will be where I create tasks that need to be started 
    and move onto “in progress” when I eventually get to the point of starting them and then “completed” when the task has been 
    completed. Also as a design plan I will simply use methods such as Adobe Photoshop, Paint tool sai , GIF or even the old school 
    Pen and pad to layout the structure of my site to create a type of vision for what I want my site to looks like.
    For the creation process I will more likely use Visual studio code as I did learn about it during the 1st week at 
    Code-Nation development course and I've found out that its primarily useful for creating html projects.
