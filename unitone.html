   <h1>Unit 1</h1>
    <h2>1.0 About me </h2>
   <p>
   Hello, My name is Nathaniel Hulson, I’m a massive gaming nerd. I have several 
   ambitions one of them is to try and gain the 
   knowledge and skills to create a video game, a comic book series and potentially an animation
   . </p> 

 <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h2>
 <p>
    During the creation of a project the developers, group or company could run into a few risks that ultimately lead to the 
    project being entirely scrapped and doomed to fail. Some of the risks that can lead a project to this form of failure are:
    <ul>
        <li>Scheduling
            <ul>
                <li>
                Scheduling is an important factor that needs to be taken very seriously and planned out almost perfectly otherwise 
                parts of the project could take more time than originally is required which can set back parts of the project or 
                even the whole project and can result in the development cost slowly creeping higher and higher and if a company is 
                backing the project up they may choose to cancel it if it doesn’t meet a certain point or functionality within a 
                specific timeframe.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Costs
            <ul>
                <li>
                Relating back to the scheduling, the cost plays a main role with a projects development as it has to be used to 
                pay the developers, resources and hardware for the project and even excess stuff such as QA testers and sometimes 
                engine licenses (The license for engines is more within the game development business). The cost of the project 
                could be raised due to scope creep (which is an increase in the projects requirements over the lifecycle) , poor 
                scheduling/ planning or even simply poor usage of the money by the company or group.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Perfromance Risks
            <ul>
                <li>
                Performance risk is the risk that when a project is complete, it may fail to perform the way a business requires 
                or does not perform the way it was intended by the business. Performance risks can also lead into the schedule and 
                cost risks if any of the technical problems increases the duration of the projects lifespan which at the same time will
                 increase the need of cost for the project.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Risks associated with external hazards
            <ul>
                <li>
                External hazards typically aren't as common but are highly unexpected, there are various types of external 
                hazards that can ange from natural disasters, electromagntic interference, terrorism etc. Often a project 
                should be backed up consistently incase any external hazard does take place or it'll result in the entire 
                project being restarted from stage 1 and will need to cost extremely more as you may have to repair/ replace 
                existing hardware.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h2>
    <p>
    When im selecting the right software and IT systems to use I would typically research 
    various aspects of different software and compare each one to see which one would be more 
    suitable for the task at hand. Let’s say that I was working on a website with a group then the software 
    that I would research about would generally be a planning software and coding software, but with just 
    these two categories there will still be more aspects and types that I’d have to research for. One of the 
    considerations I would make would be dependant on my skill level with coding, if your  skill type is relatively
    inexperienced or slightly experienced then some advanced coding software may take some practice and time to use 
    which won't be beneficial to you if you have a strict deadline. Another consideration I would factor is the cost 
    of the software, price can pay an important way with software as most software that has a paid license will 
    typically have a wider variety of features unlike open-source software but with open-source software there’s the 
    benefit of practising before paying for the advancement. As well as the price I would typically be looking at the 
    software itself as there won't be a reason for paying for software that won't be ideal for the tasks I need to complete,
    luckily some software types do tend to start off with a free trial that can let you test the main functionality of the 
    software and insight of its features.

<h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes</h2>

    <p>
    During the process of creating my website, Trello and Github has been helpful to me as they've allowed me to keep 
    track of my progression over time. Trello has helped me by allowing me to plan each section of my coursework out 
    into separate stages of progression, the progression test goes from inactive,in progress, double check and then stops 
    at completed.Each one of these trello tabs are even colour coordinated from red, yellow, orange to green. Github 
    on the other hand has been useful by allowing me to upload a version of the html file while im working on it so if 
    anything goes wrong I can download the files from the repository and work over the recent one that I uploaded, the 
    only thing that's odd about GitHub is that Github doesn’t allow you to download one single file at a time, Instead you 
    have to download the entire repository in which the file is located but this is why comments are useful as they allow me 
    to notice the difference between each version.   
    </p>

<h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h2>
    <p>
    When you are working on a project, there will be a plethora of legal guidelines that your business or group will 
     need to follow otherwise it can lead to a heavy impact of fines which can/ will likely damage the projects success 
    rate. These guidelines that need to be met are:
        <ul>
            <li>The right of users to grant consent for the use of their data
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    The GDPR (otherwise known as the General Data Protection Regulation) is the current support structure that
                     sets a guideline for the collection of personal information and the processing of the data.To ensure you don't
                      violate this and risk any impact to your project or business you need to simply set your website’s/app’s preferences 
                      to “no” or “blank” by default and also allow users to actively opt-in with the ability for users to just as easily opt-out 
                      if they aren’t interested anymore, any forms that you create for the project needs to have a minimum limit and it needs to 
                      only include data that is relevant for the task. For example on pay-as-you-go mobile services you simply get to choose whether 
                      you want to receive newsletters about deals via emails or messages so the company will only need to receive the email or mobile 
                      if the user is interested. If this section of the legal guideline is mishandled you could potentially be fined which can be upto 
                      10 million euros or upto 2% of the companies global turnovers.

                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Accessibility
                <ul>
                    <li>
                     Accessibility is the process of allowing any user to be able to access your content within your website, if you don't manage
                    to meet the requirements you will be breaching the Equality Act of 2010. To avoid breaching this Act you simply have to do a 
                    few things. First meet all the level AA of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, this just implies that you've covered the
                    accessibility for people who have impairments to their vision,hearing,mobility, and for people who have trouble with thinking 
                    and understanding (this is to help people with dyslexia, autism, or any learning difficulty). By standard every website should 
                    have some features such as speak recognition, screen magnifiers, screen readers and more useful tools to aid people. You should 
                    also conduct some form of disability user research to gain insight on which things may help them.   
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>Cyber security and protecting personal data
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    As a business it'll be your responsibility to ensure the security of all user information that is gathered within 
                    your website such as; name, address, debit/credit card details, etc, is kept secure at all costs. To possibly prevent this you’ll have to 
                    implement an ssl certificate inside your website which will encrypt the users personal data, updating your websites
                    software often will be a huge advantage. You should also test your own website to check for any security 
                    vulnerabilities that may be present. If you have a poor system setup and somehow information about your customers
                    is let out then your projects reputation and business reputation will be lowering and you may be faced with a fine
                    that could put any project at a risk.
                    </li>
                </ul>
