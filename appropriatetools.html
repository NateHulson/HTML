   <h2> 2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h2>
 
   <p>Trello and Visual Studio were very appropriate in making my website, however when I was working on css which is the front-end development of my website I could’ve used codepen to look for issues that other people might’ve experienced and used it to look for a solution. But for my website both Trello and Visual studio code were definitely the ideal tools, simply because they are simple. By this I mean that trello has a simple layout that allowed me to set tasks for myself simply in a few clicks which was ideal for me as I tend to drift away from the task at hand if I’m not aware that I have other goals to get finished after the one that I’m working one. Visual Studio code was very appropriate but at times became more of a slight game of spot the error. These errors varied from small things like bullet point list having a background box to them and sometimes text appearing in the wrong places, but that was just due to my inexperience with the software.</p>
