    <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project
    </h2>

    <p>Honestly it may sound rather redundant but if I chose to improve my website I’d simply start from the ground up but implement features I couldn't implement in the time, Some features would've been a drop down navigation bar to make it look more professional and to remove the individual navigation tabs. I would also add in a bit more color/backgrounds and the website is just bland and simple. I would even improve on the bits of code where they would have been used to create a list, I had to remove this because I used a list to create the navigation bar and when I created a list in tasks 1.2, 1.4 and 1.7 it would have created a red box behind them due to the “li” code being linked to the navigation colour.I could even have added some links to my youtube page if I managed to keep it updated so my About Me page wouldn't have looked so barebones and small.
