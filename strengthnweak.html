    <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project</h2>
    <p>
            Due to the strict time restriction on this coursework I would say that my website had more than a few strengths than weaknesses but even though it may have a few more strengths, I am not fond of it. This is merely because there hasn't been enough time for me to get used to css or html and properly practise. The weakness of the website is the layout.
            In my own opinion the website I made is far too bland and boring, if I had time I would have potentially designed something that would have suited my personal taste and even tried to experiment with more unique features except the time frame was only a few days to practise,research and create so I had no choice but to give up on the layout I originally wanted for a standard one that just works.
            <br>
            The few strengths my website has aren't surprising but obviously major. The first strength is that my website was functional, this is ideal to me as it gave me the ability to see if I can improve or change anything. Another strength of my website was the features that worked, I managed to get a navigation bar to work that allows you to move between each of the tabs easily without having to use a drop down menu which would have taken more time for me to learn and figure out.
