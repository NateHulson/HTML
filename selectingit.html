<h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software</h2>

    <p>
    When im selecting the right software and IT systems to use I would typically research 
    various aspects of different software and compare each one to see which one would be more 
    suitable for the task at hand. Let’s say that I was working on a website with a group then the software 
    that I would research about would generally be a planning software and coding software, but with just 
    these two categories there will still be more aspects and types that I’d have to research for. One of the 
    considerations I would make would be dependant on my skill level with coding, if your  skill type is relatively
    inexperienced or slightly experienced then some advanced coding software may take some practice and time to use 
    which won't be beneficial to you if you have a strict deadline. Another consideration I would factor is the cost 
    of the software, price can pay an important way with software as most software that has a paid license will 
    typically have a wider variety of features unlike open-source software but with open-source software there’s the 
    benefit of practising before paying for the advancement. As well as the price I would typically be looking at the 
    software itself as there won't be a reason for paying for software that won't be ideal for the tasks I need to complete,
    luckily some software types do tend to start off with a free trial that can let you test the main functionality of the 
    software and insight of its features.
