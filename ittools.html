    <h1>Unit 1 Outcome 2</h1>

<h2> 2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed </h2>  
<p>While using the tools I have chosen I felt like they were handling pretty well but my experience hindered the amount of stuff I could do for my website. CSS on the other hand was very new to me since I had to learn the basics on the first few days of making my website it wasn’t an easy curve to learn and is fairly confusing with div codes and since you can't see what your doing until you loaded up one of the html files into a browser it sort off leaves everything to guess, refresh and repeat. If there was a longer time frame for the website I would’ve practised using a test folder to get myself fully familiar with the software then I could’ve experimented within the software more. If I knew about Codepen before I started I would have been using it just as much as CSS as it allows you to post your code to either showcase or to seek help with issues which would’ve potentially helped me alot as I couldn’t understand some stuff and with help from others I could have slowly understand the areas where I was getting stuck at.Trello is one of the most useful tools that I could’ve used and I was happy using it simply because I could easily access my board from anywhere and change or remove labels if I needed to which allowed me to keep track of my progress.Visual Studio Code on the other hand was more likely a 50/50 as I already used the software during my first week but when it came to using HTML it was like learning a new language after almost understanding another language but luckily it wasn't that different and was slightly intriguing to learn new things while creating the website.</p>
