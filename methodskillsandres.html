<h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2>    
 <p>When you start a digital project (or any project ) there are often 5 methods that you can conduct before you fully move onto the creation stage of the project. The 5 methods are :</p>
            
              <p>Scoping</p>
                   
                       <p>Scoping is the beginning stage of any project, this is where you and anyone you work with 
                            will brainstorm ideas and asses any possibilities there can be during the projects span while 
                            also taking in the consideration of the potential threats and related challenges that are related 
                            to the project. 
                        </p>
                 <p>Planning</p>
                            <p> Planning will always be the second method of any project, this is simply because you need to 
                                sit down with any colleagues or members within your group to go over things such as hardware 
                                requirements, the functionality of the project and the roadmap that leads from start to finish. 
                                Without this your project will immediately fail as there will be no end goal to reach.
                               </p>
                    
                    <p>Development</p>
                            <p>       
                                    After you have a decent roadmap in place and a somewhat ideal rough specification of how you hope 
                                    your end project to be now you simply move onto development.  The development process will follow a 
                                    simple progression from back-end to front-end development. Back-end within the development process 
                                   includes the creation of the logic that is behind the project they are working on, Front-end is the complete 
                                    opposite of back-end as it involves less about the code and more on how a user will interpret the interface of a 
                                    website, app, etc.
                            </p>          
                    <p>Testing & Development</p>
                            
                                <p>When you have finished developing the app, you'll transition to the testing side of the project where you’ll hand 
                                    out alpha versions of your project to QA testers which will then go through the whole process of the QA testers finding 
                                    bugs and issues within the project that the developers would miss and the developers fixing the issues that have been reported. 
                                    This process will continue through both the alpha and beta version of the project until the project is at a point where its 
                                    functional, pleasant and stable for use by the consumer.
                                </p>
                        
                <p>Maintanence</p>
                            
                                <p>Maintenance is the process of maintaining the projects stability over a short or long period of time. These stability, 
                                    functionality improvements and performance fixes will often occur through a downloadable patch (update) .
                                </p>

    The skills are simply straight forward but for someone who has to manage the whole digital project there will be some that aren’t 
    quite so obvious or necessary but still can be taken into consideration.
    <br>
    One of the skills you will need when managing a digital project is to have strong leadership, this is essential as this will ensure 
    that the project requirements will be met within a set time, if there is a lack of leadership the chances of the project finishing 
    the way it is supposed to be will end up being very narrow/highly unlikely. Another skill that is required is Problem-Solving, this 
    one is just as important as having a strong leader due to how many errors can occur during the creation of every digital project, if 
    you or your team are unable to solve any errors then you won't be able to carry out any progress as you’ll lead into a dead end that 
    you can't get around or can potentially lead to the project to fail.
    One of the possible skills you’ll have to use when dealing with digital projects is FTP otherwise known as File transfer protocol. 
    This simple allows users to connect file systems and servers locally and also online. Most people will immediately think of other 
    file sharing services like Dropbox, onedrive and google drive as they are the more recognizable and more trusted but it's a high 
    chance that some vendors that you may work with will want to use FTP programs such as File Zilla, Cyberduck and transmit. So at 
    least some knowledge of FTP will be beneficial to yourself and your digital projects.
