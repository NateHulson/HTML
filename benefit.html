    <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h2>
    <P>
        IT often is a benefit when it comes to productivity and efficiency but at the same time it will often have as many drawbacks. Let's make a scene were I was working on my website and I was stuck within  a specific segment that I couldn't solve, with the aid of technology I could use certain software like slack to ask people who may know more about the coding than I would which would potentially stop me having to get up and walk over to them and wasting time but  a drawback of this is that when i would potentially message whoever, I may end up distracting them from what they are doing which will then ruin their productivity and efficiency on their website. Another benefit is that if I don't want to disturb people by asking for help I can instead look up for similar issues through the google search engine and go on websites such as W3schools to look for tips and hints but a drawback of this is that I may get bored of looking for a solution I will then be more tempting to go on social media sites which will make me waste more time than effectively use. I could also use IT tools like slack to help with the productivity and efficiency of the website by using slack within a group, the advantage of this is that we can use slack to transfer the file were working on at different moments but the downside is that with slack it does not allow everyone to work on the same project file at the same time so someone will always have a newly updated file before everyone else which also means that the other group members may get bored and lose track of the task at hand.
