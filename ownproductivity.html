    <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h2>

    <p>When I was working on my website, I know that my productivity was about 50/50 depending on the day, especially when it came to using css as somethings were causing a conflicting bug that was slowly annoying me. I could’ve improved on my own productivity by : 
            <br>
            <br>
            Team work:
            <br>
            <br>
            I could’ve used a team to aid me within the website creation as it would mean we all could have worked on separate parts at the same which not only would have kept each ones of us interested, it would have also allowed us to work on things that we wouldn't have had time for such as general designs, icons, extra coding, etc. This would have also aided the productivity as we could as each other for help if anyone got stuck. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Slack
            <br>
            <br>
            I can use slack to communicate between people who are working on a similar project,like the website, to ask for comments and to see if there's any errors that I could correct. Since I can only spot so many errors being able to ask someone else some advise with coding tips or with design ideas.
            <br>
            <br>
            Not Multitasking:    
            <br>
            <br>
            Often there will  be multiple tasks that people will get that needs to be completed,for myself it was coursework and finishing the website. But instead of doing what I was doing which was multitasking, I should’ve stuck to finishing the coursework first as I was moving from task to the other and doing a circle of getting nothing complete which means I’m more likely to be rushing and less likely to focus on the work carefully.
